# commands-wrapper

As the name implies, commands-wrapper is a tool that allows you to wrap commands, and run them using a single command of your choice.

It's simple to interact with, and very powerful for automating repetitive tasks.

## installation
```bash
pip install . --break-system-packages
```

## usage
Yaml format & options:
```yaml
command-name:
  description: "Description of the command" # required
  steps <NUM>: # <NUM> is timeout in seconds (optional)
    - command: "command to run" # required
    - send: "text to send to the command" # optional
    - press_key: "key to press" # optional
    - wait: "time to wait" # optional
```

example:
```yaml
system --update:
  description: "Quick system update"
  steps 60:
    - command: "sudo apt-get update"
    - send: "<sudo-password>"
    - command: "sudo apt-get upgrade -y"
    - send: "<sudo-password>"
```


## CLI

**list your commands:**
```bash
commands-wrapper list # or ls
```
- output:
```bash
# ---------------------- command ----------------------
# description...
# -----------------------------------------------------
```

# tip

commands-wrapper detects all `.yaml` files under `commands-wrapper` directory. You can organize them into sub-folders however you like. (or just use the default `commands.yaml` file)
